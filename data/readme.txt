This folder contains .m files to reproduce the CR_CompCode based palmprint identification results.
We suppose that you have downloaded our contactless palmprint dataset. And separate the gallery ROI samples and probe ROI samples in two different folders similar as,
"E:\standard code & dataset\Datasets\TongjiContactlessPalmprint\ROI\session1" is the gallery folder and
"E:\standard code & dataset\Datasets\TongjiContactlessPalmprint\ROI\session2" is the probe folder.
We regard the samples collected in the first session as the gallery samples and the samples collected in the second session as the probe set.

run main.m to start the program.
